FIRST Robotics 2017 Steamworks - Robot code for FRC team 3637

This project contains the robot code for teams 3637 robot to compete in the 2017 FRC game, Steamworks.  THe code is intended
to be build within an FRC framework.  It requires the WPI Library, as well as Cross The Road Electronics library for the CAN
Talon support.  Additional libraries may be needed as the code develops.  Further the code is intended to run on a robot built
similar to the Team 3637 robot.  Any deviation from that design will require updates to the code.
